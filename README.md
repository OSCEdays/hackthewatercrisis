# Description

[Stop Reset Go](http://stopresetgo.org/), in collaboration with [OSCEdays](https://oscedays.org/) and the open source group [Envienta](http://envienta.org/) organized a Glocal hackathon called **Hack the Cape Town Water Crisis** in Feb 2018 in response to the Cape Town Water Crisis. Global teams entered their projects on the OSCEdays community pages under the [Water Hackathon](https://community.oscedays.org/c/channels/water-hackathon) category. Now, we are opening this innovation platform to water stressed cities around the globe to contribute to a water design commons. Our [water crisis event information website](http://www.hackthewatercrisis.org/) is ready to be reused by any team who wants to hold a water hackathon in their city.

# Objectives
To contribute circular design innovation to a global water design commons that can be shared with water stressed cities around the globe.

# Background
Early in 2018, the City of Cape Town was faced with the potential of a complete shutdown of its municipal water system for its millions of inhabitants. As a result, the city and its inhabitants sprung into action.
