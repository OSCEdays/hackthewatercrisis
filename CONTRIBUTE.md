#  How to Contribute during #mozsprint
## Join the Water Hackathon page and participate in collaborative design
If you have solutions for the global water crisis, join the [OSCEdays](https://oscedays.org/) website for free, browse the community forum for the [Water Hackathon](https://community.oscedays.org/c/channels/water-hackathon) page and join in creating open source circular water solutions for the global water crisis.
Just browse and go to the project you are interested and start collaborating. If you have your own solution idea, start a new project page and invite others around the globe to join you. 

## Look for an upcoming June 2018 OSCEdays event
Alternatively, you can check if there is a local OSCEdays event happening in your city. If there is, enquire about whether there is a water design team.

## Participate remotely
If participating locally is out of the question, then you can remotely join and collaborate on any existing project on the website. Or, ideate your own project and invite others to join you!

## Host a local Water Hackathon
If you live in one of the water stressed cities of the globe and want to organize a local water crisis hackathon, contact us and we can discuss helping you organize a local event including reusing the [Cape Town Water Crisis Event information web template](http://www.hackthewatercrisis.org/).
