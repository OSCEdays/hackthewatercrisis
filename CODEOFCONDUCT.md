# Inclusion and Diversity
The Mozilla Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.
Mozilla-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

# Raising Issues at #mozsprint

#Working in the Open
Because working open is one of our core values, #mozsprint program planning is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration during the Festival, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their projects after #mozsprint. Learn more about [how we work open at Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open).
